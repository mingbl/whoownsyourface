            </div>
            <p>When I take a picture of myself, I know that I can do whatever I want with it. It’s my face, I can use the media I created in perpetuity without constraints. The rights to the image belong to me, and no one can legally reuse it without my permission or a valid argument for fair use/dealing.</p>
            <p>My likeness is captured in the copyright of the image. Who controls the copyright controls the face, but not always the other way around.</p>
            <p>Who should own the rights when I’m dead? The reality is complicated and could be considered morally wrong. The current chain of copyright ownership passing has led to some abhorrent but legal exploitations of the likeness of non-consenting individuals, so something needs to change.</p>

            </div>
            <p>Rights ownership becomes more complicated as more people get involved. If I took a video of someone else, it would be weird if I posted it online without asking.</p>
            <p>You could argue that, since I took the video, I own the rights, and therefore, I should have full control over how it’s used. Despite that, it still feels morally questionable to use the content without their consent, especially if it was in a way they wouldn't want.</p>

            <p>What if they were dead? Who could I ask to get permission to use that video of them?</p>
            <p>If I died tomorrow, the rights to my likeness would be passed to whoever in my bloodline is alive at the time, regardless of whether I believe they should have them.</p>
            <p>Eventually, it’ll enter the public domain; But before that happens, they could be sold or licensed to a company, giving them the freedom to use my likeness however they want.</p>
            <p>That could be unfortunate.</p>
            <p>Imagine I was an actor, and I hated being recognised for portraying a certain character.</p>
            <p>After my death, a company with the rights to my likeness uses it to promote the very character I resented.</p>
