            <p>Studios would love to treat actors like stock photo models.</p>
            <p>Typically, an actor will sign up for a job - a movie or show - and provide a performance for that specific production, or more if they make more instalments or seasons.</p>
            <p>Stock models will be photographed for stock photos and sign away their likeness so that those photos can be reused over and over again for other things.</p>
            <p>What if you could employ an actor when they're cheaper to hire, get a 3D scan of their body, and then exploit them if they become a star?</p>
            <p>All you need is their face.</p>

            <p>When a production needs a shot of a crowd of people, they must obtain release forms from everyone on screen. As a result, it’s often simpler to hire background actors/extras, which means paying more people. To an executive looking to reduce costs, it’s a problem needing a solution.</p>
            <p>So what if everyone was replaced by CGI replicas? A company could purchase a person’s likeness rights and use it forever.</p>

            <p>Terrible CGI abominations created to replace real people executives didn’t want to pay.</p>
            <p>This is the future we will get unless change is made.</p>
