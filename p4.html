            <p>What about when actors are fine with being replaced by CGI? Actors like Harrison Ford, Robert De Niro, and Mark Hamill have given permission for studios to use CGI to digitally de-age their appearance in new movies when they’re playing a younger version of their character.</p>
            <p>Digital recreations of people can’t recreate human performances, they’re just bad copies of their faces. The performance of a digitally de-aged Mark Hamill in <i>The Mandalorian</i> (2019) is not nearly as moving as the performance by actual 26-year old Mark Hamill in <i>Star Wars</i> (1977), yet audiences cheer at seeing a wrinkleless face because it’s something they recognise from decades ago. A person, in the eyes of corporations and fanatics who are weirdly protective of them, is no more than the face atop their body. If a company owns the person’s face, they own the person.</p>
            <p>Soon, we’ll no longer have actors; Just vessels, unknown actors used for their body performance, whose faces will be replaced with the 3D model of an actor who was scanned 20 years ago.</p>
