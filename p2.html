            </div>
            <p><a href="https://www.closerweekly.com/posts/superman-actor-george-reeves/">George Reeves</a> was an actor who commit suicide after suffering with depression stemming from his heavy association with his role as ‘Superman’.</p>
            <p>In 1956, three years before his death, George Reeves stated in an interview with the Akron Beacon Journal, “Most movie producers feel I’m too closely identified with Superman, so [they] won’t use me.”</p>
            <p>60 years later, Warner Bros - owner of the rights to his likeness - digitally recreated Reeves’ face and body so his reanimated corpse could reprise the very role that gave him so much grief.</p>
            <p>The movie producers ended up finding a use for his face.</p>

            <p>Is this how he would have wanted his legacy to turn out? I’d wager not, and I protest how this could have been allowed. Legally, Warner Bros may have the right, but morally they shouldn’t.</p>
            <p>Some contemporary <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/news/keanu-reeves-cgi-clause-b2283733.html">actors are now specifying in their contract</a> that their likeness cannot be replicated and used in this manner, but just because other actors don’t have that specific clause in their contract, doesn’t mean studios should be allowed to do this.</p>
            <p>Reeves could not have foreseen that a corporation would want to use his face for a CGI animated cameo in 60 years time, so of course, this clause wasn’t in his contract.</p>
            <p>George Reeves gets nothing out of it - he’s long since dead, while the studio makes millions of dollars using his face. The company owns his face, and dead people can’t complain.</p>
            <p>This isn’t right. No consent was given here. Permission is not the absence of a ‘no’ but the presence of a ‘yes’, and just because Reeves didn’t say “Don’t recreate my face with CGI in 60 years” doesn’t mean Warner Bros should be allowed to do so.</p>
