            <p>It’s the performance of an actor that gives a character life, not their face.</p>
            <p>How many actors have played James Bond? Could you imagine if Daniel Craig was wearing Sean Connery’s face for 2021’s <i>No Time to Die</i>?</p>
            <p>BBC’s Doctor Who created a brilliant solution for characters to continue when their actors left in 1966, when William Hartnell (who played ‘Dr. Who’, the lead role) was increasingly growing ill due to old age and health problems, and a decision was made for him to exit the show. The BBC, along with Hartnell, wanted the show to continue without him, so the character was recast.</p>
            <p>Rather than cast another old man to replicate Hartnell’s likeness, the new Dr. Who became Patrick Troughton, someone who looks nothing like William Hartnell and did not wear any sort of makeup to imitate Hartnell’s appearance. The very act of the replacement was weaved into the narrative of the show, and enabled it to continue for 60 years as the role has regularly been recast.</p>

            <p>They made a conscious decision not to stay hung up on the likeness of an actor, and sprouted an ingenious and creative idea that made the show a continuous success. </p>
            <p>This couldn’t have happened if they continued to use the face of an old man.</p>
            
            <p>If you’re an actor, and you’re fine with your likeness being used well into eternity, then you could be preventing someone else later on from becoming a star - because the only thing the studios care about is your face. Not the heart and soul you put into a performance, or the years of training and experience you needed in order to get there - just your appearance, what you happened to look like that one time when you were filming.</p>
            <p>It is detrimental to art and humanity to not let the dead rest and move forward by continuing using people’s faces past their expiration date.</p>
